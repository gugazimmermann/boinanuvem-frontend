## 🌐 Internationalization

The application supports multiple languages:
- Portuguese (pt) - Default
- English (en)
- Spanish (es)

Language files are located in `app/i18n/translations/`. The language context provides translation hooks throughout the application.

### Translation Coverage

All user-facing strings are internationalized, including:
- Animal movement types and labels
- Form labels and placeholders
- Error messages and notifications
- Table headers and filters
- Button labels and actions

The application uses a comprehensive translation system with type-safe translation keys and fallback support.

## 🎨 Theming

The application supports both light and dark themes with automatic system preference detection. Theme preferences are persisted in localStorage.

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

### Build Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t boinanuvem-frontend .
```

### Run Container

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 boinanuvem-frontend
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Docker Multi-Stage Build

The Dockerfile uses a multi-stage build process:
1. **development-dependencies-env**: Installs all dependencies
2. **production-dependencies-env**: Installs production dependencies only
3. **build-env**: Builds the application
4. **Final stage**: Creates minimal production image

## 📦 Production Build

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

The build output will be in the `build/` directory:
```
build/
├── client/    # Static assets
└── server/    # Server-side code
```

### Running Production Build

```bash
npm run start
```

## 🚢 Deployment

### Platform Options

The containerized application can be deployed to any platform that supports Docker:

- **AWS ECS** - Elastic Container Service
- **Google Cloud Run** - Serverless container platform
- **Azure Container Apps** - Managed container platform
- **Digital Ocean App Platform** - Platform-as-a-Service
- **Fly.io** - Global application platform
- **Railway** - Modern deployment platform

### Environment Variables

Make sure to configure the following environment variables for production:

- `NODE_ENV=production` - Set to production mode
- Any API endpoints or service URLs your application requires
- Additional environment-specific configuration as needed

## 🧪 Testing

The project uses **Vitest** for unit and integration testing with **React Testing Library** for component testing.

### Running Tests

Run all tests:
```bash
npm test
```

Run tests with UI (interactive mode):
```bash
npm run test:ui
```

Run tests and generate coverage report:
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

Run tests in watch mode:
```bash
npm run test:watch
```

### Test Coverage

The project maintains comprehensive test coverage with **76+ test files** and **667+ passing tests** covering:
- **Components**: UI components, dashboard components, and site components
- **Hooks**: Custom React hooks (CEP lookup, CNPJ lookup, auto-rotate, smooth scroll)
- **Contexts**: Theme and language contexts
- **Utilities**: Helper functions and utilities
- **Types**: Type definitions and validations
- **i18n**: Translation keys and internationalization
- **Mocks**: Mock data functions and data management
- **Routes**: Route components and navigation

Coverage reports are generated in the `coverage/` directory and can be viewed by opening `coverage/index.html` in a browser.

### Test Structure

Tests are located alongside their source files in `__tests__` directories:
```
app/
├── components/
│   ├── ui/
│   │   └── __tests__/     # UI component tests
│   ├── dashboard/
│   │   └── __tests__/     # Dashboard component tests
│   └── site/
│       └── __tests__/     # Site component tests
├── contexts/
│   └── __tests__/         # Context tests
├── hooks/
│   └── __tests__/         # Hook tests
└── utils/
    └── __tests__/         # Utility tests
```

### Testing Tools

- **Vitest** - Fast unit test framework
- **React Testing Library** - Component testing utilities
- **@testing-library/jest-dom** - Custom DOM matchers
- **@testing-library/user-event** - User interaction simulation
- **jsdom** - DOM implementation for Node.js testing environment

## 🧪 Code Quality

### Type Checking

Run TypeScript type checking:

```bash
npm run typecheck
```

This command generates React Router types and runs the TypeScript compiler. The project maintains strict TypeScript configuration with full type safety across all components, utilities, and mock data functions.

### Type Safety Features

- **Strict Mode**: Full TypeScript strict mode enabled
- **Type Inference**: Comprehensive type inference for better developer experience
- **Generic Components**: Reusable generic components with proper type constraints
- **Mock Data Types**: Fully typed mock data with proper interfaces

### Linting

Check code quality with ESLint:

```bash
npm run lint
```

Automatically fix linting issues:

```bash
npm run lint:fix
```

The project uses ESLint with TypeScript-specific rules, React hooks rules, and accessibility checks. All code follows consistent linting standards with zero warnings in production code.

### Code Formatting

Format code with Prettier:

```bash
npm run format
```

Check formatting without making changes:

```bash
npm run format:check
```
